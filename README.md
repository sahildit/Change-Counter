I will be working on this project with my team members [ Taif Al Beedh and Mariana Pirtac]
The aim of this project is to create a program that counts the number of coins in an image and then calculate their amount.
The approach taken for this project was : each member will work on the project from start to finish in their own way and at the end the code will be merged with the group members.
